#    The modernize flags control various behaviours in Minetest Classic that
#    (when a flag is enabled) differ from how Minetest-c55 0.3 would have behaved.
#    By default a conservative but reasonable compromise between faithfulness and
#    modern engine features is enabled.
#    Note that some differences in behaviour are unavoidable or miniscule, not
#    everything is configurable.
