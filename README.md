# Minetest Classic

[![ContentDB](https://content.minetest.net/packages/sfan5/minetest_classic/shields/downloads/)](https://content.minetest.net/packages/sfan5/minetest_classic/)

This game is a recreation of the classic Minetest-c55 0.3 gameplay, including:

* Original textures
* All four mobs¹
* Identical items, crafting recipes, dig times; closely matched ore distribution

Unlike the original it has (optional) support for:

* Sounds
* PvP
* Localization
* Engine features such as the modern skybox, waving or shadows
* Modern creative inventory and per-player creative mode

To control some of the modern features check out "Modernize flags" in the settings menu.
For an experience faithful to 0.3 you should disable Fancy leaves and 3D Clouds on your client.

This is a game for the [Minetest engine](https://www.minetest.net/), install
at least version 5.6.0 to play it.

**¹**: Fireflies do not spawn naturally and are only available in creative mode.
